# snakes-n-ladders-cpp
This is a small c++ game of snakes and ladders that I codded to practice some basic but essential c++ coding skills. The game can be played on 1 console with an unlimited amount of players.

#**instructions:**
To start the game just run the main.cpp file and the game will automatically lauch with intrictions appearing on the screen such as choosing the number of players for the game and other in game instructions once the number of players is set and the game starts.
